Description
This is a silksong themed memory match game. It is played by clicking and revealing two tiles to see if they are a match. When a match is found the tiles stay flipped over, and the game is won when all tiles are flipped over.

What I learned
The main new thing that I learned was how to use keyframes to make an animation. I also learned a lot of new javascript techniques as well as how to utilize a combination relative and absolute positioning in css to get things to look how I want them to (getting centered content not to move when it's textContents change was way more annoying than I had anticipated).

AI Usage
I used chatGPT to assist in debuging as well as asking for help on what functions are useful and how to do certain tasks that I am unaware of how to do.

AI Reflection
AI was typically pretty good at finding why an error was happening, as well as explaining how/why a line of code works at a verry in depth level. It was typically pretty bad at helping me get my html to look the way I want with spacing and such.
